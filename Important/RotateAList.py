'''
John Watson performs an operation called a right circular rotation on an array of integers, . After performing one right circular rotation operation, the array is transformed from  to .

Watson performs this operation  times. To test Sherlock's ability to identify the current element at a particular position in the rotated array, Watson asks  queries, where each query consists of a single integer, , for which you must print the element at index  in the rotated array (i.e., the value of ).

Input Format

The first line contains  space-separated integers, , , and , respectively. 
The second line contains  space-separated integers, where each integer  describes array element  (where ). 
Each of the  subsequent lines contains a single integer denoting .

Constraints

Output Format

For each query, print the value of the element at index  of the rotated array on a new line.
