Question : You are given a playlist of music and you have to do a perfect shuffling of songs such that no song remains at its original positon

Solution : There is a famous algorithm of shuffling a given array of integers - known as Fisher-Yeats Shiffling Algorithm.

Map each song to a number equal to index of array integers in the array and run this algorithm to shuffle the index and then to play a particular song
, just print the value of that index of music to play the song in the playlist
